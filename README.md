# Wireframing

## Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating low-fidelity visual guides that represent the skeletal structure of a digital interface. It is used early in the design process to establish the basic layout and structure of a page or application.

## Why Wireframing is Important

- 🔍 **Clarifies Structure:** Helps define the layout and hierarchy of content and functionality.
- 🧠 **Supports Ideation:** Encourages brainstorming and experimentation without focusing on visual details.
- 🤝 **Facilitates Communication:** Bridges the gap between designers, developers, and stakeholders by visualizing ideas.
- 🛠️ **Saves Time and Cost:** Identifies potential issues early before development begins, reducing costly changes later.

## When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are typically used:
- In the early stages of a project
- Before creating high-fidelity mockups
- To get stakeholder approval on layouts
- As a blueprint for developers to start implementation
